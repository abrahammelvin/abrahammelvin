     <h2><q>Fully vaccinated</q> doesn’t mean <q>immune to COVID-19</q></h2>

<p class="paragraphs"> As restrictions and mask mandates are dropped around the county, people who are fully vaccinated might be
feeling the return-to-normal fantasy. But Dr. Cardona warns that now still isn’t the time to let your guard
down. While the vaccines are potent, there’s still a chance that you could become infected.</p>
<p class="paragraphs">Dr. Cardona explains.</p>
<p><q>‘Fully vaccinated’ means that you completed a COVID-19 vaccine series as recommended for the best
protection against severe complications such as hospitalizations and/or death. No vaccine offers 100%
protection against illness, yet it does give you a better chance to fight off the infectious consequences of being
exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus.</q></p>
<h2>Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to others,
including other vaccinated people?</h2>
<p class="paragraphs">While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit COVID-19 may occur at a lower rate. She adds
that this could also be a reality for people who don’t have a good immune response to vaccines.</p>
<p class="paragraphs"><q>The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health disorders may
not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccines. We are still collecting data
and doing ongoing research about the vaccine responses in these vulnerable populations. </q></p>
